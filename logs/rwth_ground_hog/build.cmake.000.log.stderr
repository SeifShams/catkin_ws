[33m[1mCMake Warning[0m at /home/seif/catkin_ws/src/spencer_people_tracking/detection/monocular_detectors/rwth_ground_hog/CMakeLists.txt:24 (message):
  libcudaHOG not found: Compiling rwth_ground_hog without any functionality.
  This is just a convenience function to not break compilation on systems
  without NVIDIA graphics cards.  People detection will work without the
  ground_hog but won't be able to detect people far away from the robot.
  Please install libcudaHOG from the rwth_perception_people/3rd_party
  directory if possible.
